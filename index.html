                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Kolby I am a 21yr old Australian and live in the east suburbs of Melbourne. I recently moved to 
                        Melbourne from NT, Darwin where I spent the first twenty years of my life growing up. I am the only boy with 
                        three sisters who are all older than me. My favourite hobbies are working out, playing sport and playing video 
                        games. My favourite sport is rugby league but recently because of covid I started mountain biking and have taken 
                        a lot of interest to it. I graduated Year twelve and started an electrical apprenticeship in Darwin and after two 
                        years I moved to Melbourne and planned to finish it, but covid-19 came along, then I was unable to find electrical 
                        work. Currently I am working as a civil labourer where I operate heavy machinery.

                    <h2>
                        Interest in IT
                    </h2>
                        My interest in IT started when I was young, probably around four or five and like most people my interest was 
                        sparked through video games. My most memorable experience playing video games comes from my PlayStation two and 
                        two of my favourite games ever MX VS ATV unleashed and GTA San Andreas. As I got older my interest in IT grew 
                        and I found myself doing research to build my own gaming pc and learning about how games are made. 
                    <h3>
                        Why RMIT
                    </h3>
                        My interest in IT got me looking at options to enter the industry but because I moved away from my family, I 
                        needed options that gave me flexibility to work and learn. After looking around I found open universities 
                        Australia and I decided that studying information technologies online through RMIT was the best fit for me.
                    <h3>
                        Expectations of study
                    </h3> 
                        During my studies I expect to get a good idea for most of the fields in IT and hope to learn practical knowledge 
                        that I can use to find work and execute my job with a good understanding of the industry.

                        Ideal Job 
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        My ideal job would be a game developer. The reason I would choose game development is because video games 
                        have played such a crucial role in my interest in IT. Working for a triple-A game developer would not be my 
                        first choice, preferably a smaller indie team meaning a team without any Financial or technical support from 
                        a large game publisher. Working with a small team would mean I get more of a say in what type of game is made, 
                        how it is made, and most importantly the quality of that game.
                    </p>

                        Chance at qualifying for position

                    <p>
                        I basically do not qualify for this job in any of the practical parts. My coding and unity skills are verry 
                        minimal. I do how ever have a passion for videogames, I work well under pressure, I work well in a team, 
                        and I am open to criticism even encouraging it. My chances of currently obtaining a position at flow studio 
                        are verry low.

                    <p>
                        In order to become qualified for this roll I must first start by seeking a bachelors in the required field, 
                        build experience by developing my own games and or working in an entry level roll for someone designing 
                        video games, build my skills in unity and C# through courses and tutorials and build up my communication 
                        skills where they lack.

                        My thoughts
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The results seem to show that I am an agreeable person who thinks logically and rationally. This is 
                        something I would agree with, and I find myself putting feelings aside when making important decisions. 
                        The big five shows I am an easy person to get along with, I dont let my emotions control me except for 
                        overindulging sometimes, I am open to adventure and self-efficient. The Myers brigs shows that I am a driven 
                        and determined leader although ruthless in my level of rationality. Education planner shows I am a hands-on 
                        learner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the results mostly show I am a good team member because I get along with people, rationalise my 
                        position and I dont use emotions in my decision making. I think my lack of emotion when completing tasks is 
                        what might hold me back because sometimes it is important to take emotions into consideration especially when 
                        working in a team. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think when forming a team, I dont need to be too conscious of these results because I find people work 
                        well with me as long as I put in a good effort and be myself. Most of the results show I am already a good 
                        team member, and I can work well as a leader. The only thing I need to worry about is considering the 
                        emotions of others.

                    <h2>
                        Project Idea  
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The idea I have come up with is a workout app mainly targeting professional Athletes but accessible to 
                        everyone. The workout app will still have the basic features of any other workout app, planning workouts and 
                        tracking progress but the main difference will be data collection. After receiving permission to track the users
                        workout and dieting progression, the data from the user will be collected and processed using machine learning
                        that will creat personlised workout programs for someones spercific goals. A personal trainer in your pocket. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Motivation For building the app 

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        My motivation behind this comes from my enjoyment of sport and the competitive nature of it. Many athletes 
                        and people are looking for effective ways to improve their physical performance and this app will provide 
                        taylor made advise and information that best suits that individual. In 2017 21.5% of the population fifteen 
                        years and older participated in sports related activities three or more times per week that’s 4.3 million 
                        people who could use the app to better their performance. It can be hard to compete in sport competitively 
                        and have the research and know how to best set up a program for the best individual results and this app 
                        idea will hopefully provide that.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What is the app
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The app will be a simple to use fitness app that allows the user to track their fitness goals. Included in 
                        it will be a basic workout tracking section that allows you to input workouts, for example if you are bench 
                        pressing you could enter the amount of wait you are benching, the number of repartitions and the number of 
                        sets and it will keep track of this data so you can look back on results. There will also be a diet section 
                        you can track your protein, calories, fats and other nutritional factors. The app will use real world proven
                        statistics and compiled data from all users of the app, and it will provide reasonable recommendation to the 
                        user to make changes to their workouts and diet. For example If someone was training to improve the max weight 
                        they can bench press, the app will use the information from others who have successfully increased their bench 
                        press and apply that info to users who are trying to increas there own bench press results 

                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first version of the app might be verry basic only providing advice on weight loss and how to improve on
                         certain workouts most likely the three main compound movements people do, deadlift, bench and squat. 
                         Focusing on weight loss and these three compound movements allows time for the app to collect initial data 
                         but still provide productive information to users because almost every high-level fitness program consists 
                         of these exercises and a good diet. After the app has been running and has collected sufficient data it 
                         will be able to make educated guesses on what workout routines and what diets best suits individual users. 
                         The result is an app that allows you to track your fitness goals and provide advice to help you effectively 
                         and efficiently execute your goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app will be powered by artificial intelligence that is focused on the users fitness goals. The app will
                         with minimal help from people create its own fitness programs. This will eliminate the cost that is
                          associated with personal trainers but still provide solid reliable advice
                    </p>

                        Tools to build application
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The app will run on most smart phones so it will need a multi-platform front end coding language such as 
                        flutter. The apps back end needs to be a solid programming language that can handle data analytics and 
                        machine learning, python probably being the best option. The app will need to be developed on a PC or Mac 
                        and the information gathered will have to be stored on a server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Obtaining The software and hardware required will be the easiest part of the app development because all the 
                        required software is free and can be found online and easily downloaded. The only barrier to getting the
                         correct hardware is financing. The hardest part will be having all the skills to make the app because there 
                         are a large range of industries and fields that cross over to complete this task.
                    </p>

                    <p>If the app was successfully made most people would have access to fitness advise they otherwise would 
                        have had to of payed for by hiring a personal trainer. If the app was successfully created the problem 
                        of funding would have been solved by an investor or I would of had to front the costs myself. The lack of skills could 
                        be overcome by hiring skilled people or studying and learning the skills required myself.
